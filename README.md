# Animated Travel Landing Page
* Quick HTML, CSS and JS project that uses animations in CSS and simple low level JS to create an animated landing page. There's also a mp4 video background but the video is too big to fit on Github. :-(

## How to spin up
* Pull the repository down 
* Add a (preferably) 16:9 .mp4 file named "explore.mp4" to the media folder
* Open index.html
* Be amazed at css
